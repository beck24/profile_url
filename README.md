# profile_url

Member profile urls in the form of: `http://example.com/<username>`


## Instructions

Unzip the archive to the mod directory of your Elgg installation

Activate the plugin in the admin plugins page


### Caveats

This plugin prevents users from registering with usernames that are also registered
pagehandlers.  This cannot do anything about existing users that have usernames
equivalent to pagehandlers prior to this plugin being activated.  Any users with
usernames that are existing pagehandlers will not be able to access their profile.
